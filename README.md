"Pi contains the universe," [they say](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/1psbto/pi_contains_the_universe/) or [wonder](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/216343/does-pi-contain-all-possible-number-combinations).

This is actually [not true](http://justinparrtech.com/JustinParr-Tech/pi-does-not-contain-the-universe/), but this app allows you to explore pi by representing different digit samples from it as RGB images. Do you think you can find Mona Lisa in this random noise? :-)
